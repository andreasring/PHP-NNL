# PHP-NNL (PHP Neural Network Library)
PHP-NNL is a library for performing various Neural Network related tasks.

PHP-NNL is not written to be a state of the art performing library, but rather be an educational library. Performance will of course be a pripority throughout the project.

Feel free to use code from this library any way you want.


## Goals of the project
- Give a good overview of the huge field of neural networks
- Prioritize practical implementation, visualization and documentation over huge amounts of math
- Implement the most used, newest, hottest and best neural network architectures
- Give an optional verbose output without compremising performance when not enabled
- Good visualization and statistics about the network
- Modular design
- Performance with regards to the fact that this is PHP


## What is Neural Networks?
Short description goes here.
However if you have no idea, even after reading the above, what neural networks is. Why are you here?


## Why PHP?
It's simple: I do a lot of web development and love it.


### But but but... Performance? :(
Yes, PHP might not be as performant as an optimized C application or even lower-level, but that is not the point of this project either.
And even if it was, you will always need to do project-specific optimalizations for neural network applications that needs optimalization in the first place.

With the relatively new version of PHP: PHP7! You can at least compete with very popular languages for neural networks like Python and Java.
